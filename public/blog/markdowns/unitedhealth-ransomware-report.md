## 1. Mistakes Made

The primary mistake in this incident was insufficient cybersecurity measures at Change Healthcare, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary and major healthcare technology company. Specific failures likely included:

- Inadequate network segmentation, allowing the attackers to move laterally within the system
- Outdated or unpatched software, providing potential entry points for attackers
- Insufficient employee training on cybersecurity best practices and phishing awareness
- Lack of robust multi-factor authentication across all systems
- Inadequate backup and disaster recovery procedures

## 2. How It Was Discovered

The ransomware attack was discovered on February 21, 2024, when Change Healthcare detected unusual activity within its network. The company immediately initiated its incident response protocol and began investigating the scope of the breach.

## 3. Identification of the Culprit

As of the latest available information, the specific threat actor responsible for the attack has not been publicly identified. However, cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies are actively investigating the incident.

The method of identifying the attackers likely involves:

- Analysis of the malware used in the attack
- Examination of network logs and traffic patterns
- Investigation of ransom demands and communication channels used by the attackers
- Collaboration with other healthcare organizations and cybersecurity firms to identify similar attack patterns

## 4. Damage Caused

The ransomware attack on Change Healthcare caused significant disruption to the U.S. healthcare system:

- Widespread outages of Change Healthcare's systems, affecting claims processing, payment services, and pharmacy services
- Financial losses for healthcare providers due to delayed payments and increased administrative costs
- Potential exposure of sensitive patient data, although UnitedHealth Group stated that there was no evidence of data exfiltration
- Disruption to patient care as some healthcare providers struggled to verify insurance coverage and process prescriptions
- Reputational damage to UnitedHealth Group and Change Healthcare

The full extent of the financial impact is still being assessed, but early estimates suggest it could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
