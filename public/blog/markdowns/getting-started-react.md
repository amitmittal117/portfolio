# Getting Started with React

React has revolutionized the way we build web applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of React and how to get started with your first React application.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's used by millions of developers and has a robust ecosystem.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Components**
   - Building blocks of React applications
   - Can be functional or class-based
   - Promote code reusability

2. **JSX**
   - Syntax extension for JavaScript
   - Allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript
   - Makes component code more readable

3. **State and Props**
   - State: Internal component data
   - Props: Data passed between components
   - Both trigger re-renders when changed

## Setting Up Your First React Project

```bash
npx create-react-app my-first-app
cd my-first-app
npm start
