## Mistakes Made
1. Inadequate cybersecurity measures: The fact that the attack succeeded suggests that Sixt's IT security infrastructure may have had vulnerabilities.
2. Delayed detection: The attack was detected on April 29, but it's unclear how long the attackers had access before discovery.
3. Service disruption: The incident resulted in customer services being taken offline, indicating a lack of robust business continuity plans.

## How It Was Discovered
Sixt detected "IT irregularities" on April 29, 2022. The specific method of detection was not publicly disclosed, but it likely involved internal monitoring systems or anomaly detection tools that flagged unusual activity within their network.

## Identification of the Culprit
As of the available information, Sixt did not publicly identify the specific culprit behind the cyber-attack. It's common for companies to withhold such information during ongoing investigations or due to security concerns.

## Damage Caused
1. Service Disruption: Multiple customer services were taken offline, affecting Sixt's ability to serve its clients effectively.
2. Customer Dissatisfaction: The service disruptions led to many disgruntled Sixt patrons, potentially damaging the company's reputation and customer relationships.
3. Financial Impact: While specific figures were not provided, the attack likely resulted in financial losses due to service downtime and potential remediation costs.
4. Data Concerns: Although not explicitly stated in the provided information, cyber-attacks often raise concerns about potential data breaches, which could have long-term implications for customer trust and regulatory compliance.
