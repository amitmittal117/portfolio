## 1. Mistakes Made
- Inadequate security measures to protect customer data:
  - Failure to implement robust encryption for sensitive customer information
  - Insufficient access controls and authentication mechanisms
  - Lack of regular security audits and penetration testing
- Vulnerabilities in T-Mobile's network infrastructure:
  - Unprotected router exposed to the internet, serving as an entry point for the attacker
  - Outdated or unpatched systems that could be exploited
  - Poor network segmentation, allowing lateral movement once the attacker gained initial access
- Insufficient monitoring and detection systems:
  - Delayed identification of the breach, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate large amounts of data
  - Inadequate logging and alerting mechanisms to flag suspicious activities
  - Possible gaps in the incident response plan, leading to slower reaction times

## 2. How It Was Discovered
The breach was initially discovered when a hacker posted on an underground forum claiming to have obtained T-Mobile customer data. The post, made on August 13, 2021, offered to sell a subset of the stolen data for 6 bitcoin (approximately $270,000 at the time).
T-Mobile was alerted to the potential breach and launched an investigation. On August 16, 2021, the company confirmed unauthorized access to its systems and began working with cybersecurity experts to assess the extent of the damage.
The company's statement indicated that they had located and closed the access point that the attacker used to gain entry to their servers. However, by this time, significant amounts of customer data had already been exfiltrated.
## 3. Identification of the Culprit
The attack was reportedly carried out by John Binns, a 21-year-old American living in Turkey. Binns claimed responsibility for the breach in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on August 26, 2021.
Key points about the culprit:
  - Binns stated that he had been searching for gaps in T-Mobile's defenses through its internet addresses and gained access to a Washington state data center that stored customer data.
  - He exploited an unprotected router to gain access to T-Mobile's network, describing the company's security as "awful."
  - Binns claimed his motivation was to gain attention and notoriety, rather than financial gain.
  - He also alleged that he had been persecuted by US government agencies, suggesting a possible motive for targeting a major US company.
While T-Mobile did not officially confirm Binns as the attacker, they acknowledged that a "bad actor" had illegally accessed their systems.
